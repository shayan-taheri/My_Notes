There are two cases for this process:

1) If "Hspice" simulator is used, then the generated "File_Name.tr0" file from simulation can be used in HSPICE Toolbox for MATLAB.

2) If other simulators such as Nanosim or CustomSim are used, then the provided codes in the "Codes" directory can be used to process "File_Name.meas" output file.

Notice: You can adjust the sampling rate according to the transient analysis time step!
